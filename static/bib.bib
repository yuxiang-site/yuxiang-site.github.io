  abstract  = {Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to help developers automatically patch software bugs. However, current state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based APR techniques face the problem of limited patch variety, failing to fix complicated bugs. This is mainly due to the reliance on bug-fixing datasets to craft fix templates (traditional) or directly predict potential patches (learning-based). Large Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs), trained using billions of text/code tokens, can potentially help avoid this issue. Very recently, researchers have directly leveraged LLMs for APR without relying on any bug-fixing datasets. Meanwhile, such existing work either failed to include state-of-the-art LLMs or was not evaluated on realistic datasets. Thus, the true power of modern LLMs on the important APR problem is yet to be revealed.In this work, we perform the first extensive study on directly applying LLMs for APR. We select 9 recent state-of-the-art LLMs, including both generative and infilling models, ranging from 125M to 20B in size. We designed 3 different repair settings to evaluate the different ways we can use LLMs to generate patches: 1) generate the entire patch function, 2) fill in a chunk of code given the prefix and suffix 3) output a single line fix. We apply the LLMs under these repair settings on 5 datasets across 3 different languages and compare different LLMs in the number of bugs fixed, generation speed and compilation rate. We also compare the LLMs against recent state-of-the-art APR tools. Our study demonstrates that directly applying state-of-the-art LLMs can already substantially outperform all existing APR techniques on all our datasets. Among the studied LLMs, the scaling effect exists for APR where larger models tend to achieve better performance. Also, we show for the first time that suffix code after the buggy line (adopted in infilling-style APR) is important in not only generating more fixes but more patches with higher compilation rate. Besides patch generation, the LLMs consider correct patches to be more natural than other ones, and can even be leveraged for effective patch ranking or patch correctness checking. Lastly, we show that LLM-based APR can be further substantially boosted via: 1) increasing the sample size, and 2) incorporating fix template information.},

  abstract   = {In the past decade, Deep Learning (DL) systems have been widely deployed in various application domains to facilitate our daily life, e.g., natural language processing, healthcare, activity recognition, and autonomous driving. Meanwhile, it is extremely challenging to ensure the correctness of DL systems (e.g., due to their intrinsic nondeterminism), and bugs in DL systems can cause serious consequences and may even threaten human lives. In the literature, researchers have explored various techniques to test, analyze, and verify DL models, since their quality directly affects the corresponding system behaviors. Recently, researchers have also proposed novel techniques for testing the underlying operator-level DL libraries (such as TensorFlow and PyTorch), which provide general binary implementations for each high-level DL operator and are the foundation for running DL models on different hardware platforms. However, there is still limited work targeting the reliability of the emerging tensor compilers (also known as DL compilers), which aim to automatically compile high-level tensor computation graphs directly into high-performance binaries for better efficiency, portability, and scalability than traditional operator-level libraries. Therefore, in this paper, we target the important problem of tensor compiler testing, and have proposed Tzer, a practical fuzzing technique for the widely used TVM tensor compiler. Tzer focuses on mutating the low-level Intermediate Representation (IR) for TVM due to the limited mutation space for the high-level IR. More specifically, Tzer leverages both general-purpose and tensor-compiler-specific mutators guided by coverage feedback for diverse and evolutionary IR mutation; furthermore, since tensor compilers provide various passes (i.e., transformations) for IR optimization, Tzer also performs pass mutation in tandem with IR mutation for more effective fuzzing. Our experimental results show that Tzer substantially outperforms existing fuzzing techniques on tensor compiler testing, with 75\% higher coverage and 50\% more valuable tests than the 2nd-best technique. Also, different components of Tzer have been validated via ablation study. To date, Tzer has detected 49 previously unknown bugs for TVM, with 37 bugs confirmed and 25 bugs fixed (PR merged).},

article{character-inpainting,
	abstract = {Character inpainting is an attractive and challenging task, especially for Chinese calligraphy characters with complex structures and styles. The diversity of Chinese calligraphy styles has created its unique artistic beauty, but specific style features will lead to obvious differences in style and stroke details while recovering. Most current methods are restricted to recover specific characters already present in the training set and retrain the model when recovering characters of new styles. Moreover, these methods are based on edge recovery, which requires the location of the masked area. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-guided generative framework guided by prototype character, which can not only adapt to multiple style fonts but also overall recover glyph structure and strokes without masked information by inferring the style representation. In this case, our method can recover new style characters, which is the first attempt for character inpainting without parameter retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has generalizability and superiority in most application scenarios, compared with several state-of-the-art character inpainting methods.},
