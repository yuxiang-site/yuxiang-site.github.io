## About

I am a PhD candidate at [UIUC CS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), advised by [Lingming Zhang](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu). I was also a student researcher at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/) from 2024--2025, working at the CodeGen/CodeLlama team.

<!-- [Sida Wang](https://www.sidaw.xyz), [Rishabh Singh](https://rishabhmit.bitbucket.io), [Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io), and [Gabriel Synnaeve](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wN9rBkcAAAAJ&hl=en). I train LLMs for code and software.-->

I train code agents.

## Research

**Research impact:** I lead [Self-Play SWE-RL (SSR)](https://x.com/YuxiangWei9/status/2003541373853524347?s=20), [SWE-RL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/swe-rl) (NeurIPS'25), [Magicoder](https://github.com/ise-uiuc/magicoder) (ICML'24), and [SelfCodeAlign](https://github.com/bigcode-project/selfcodealign) (NeurIPS'24), projects that have captured broad attention and are widely adopted across industry and open source.

**New:** We released [Self-Play SWE-RL (SSR)](https://x.com/YuxiangWei9/status/2003541373853524347?s=20), which trains a single LLM agent to self-improve by self-playing between bug-injection and bug-repair, grounded in real-world repositories, no human-labeled issues or tests.

<!-- , with experience and published results in pretraining, midtraining, and posttraining via synthetic data and reinforcement learning. -->

<!-- **Research impact:** I lead [Magicoder](https://github.com/ise-uiuc/magicoder) (ICML'24) and [SelfCodeAlign](https://github.com/bigcode-project/selfcodealign) (NeurIPS'24), projects with **400k+ downloads and 2.2k+ GitHub stars**. They have been adopted by leading industry language models, including **Meta Llama 3**, **Google CodeGemma**, and **IBM Granite code models**. -->
